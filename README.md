# Payment Prediction AlgorithmPayment - Thinh Le
# (Classification Algorithms)

## Dataset:

-   Payment information from 30000 online purchase orders

-   Each online purchase order and is described by 44 attributes

## Task:

-   To help the online trader to recognize if a person who makes an order is a customer who will eventually pay the goods by using data mining techniques

-   Apply data cleaning and remove irrelevant information

-   Randomly split the data set into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%)

-   Use a classification algorithm to build a prediction model based on the training data

## How to run:

-   Put the dataset in the same directory with the code

-   Pre-process the dataset:

    ```
    python preprocessing.py
    ```

-   Run Perceptron classification:
    ```
    python perceptron.py
    ```
